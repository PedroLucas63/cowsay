## Overview üåü

Cowsay Clone is a fun clone of the original cowsay with some extra features to make cow messages even more humorous and customizable. It allows you to create cow messages with different moods, column sizes, eyes, tongue, and more.

## Features üöÄ

- Choose your cow's mood: borg (-b), dead (-d), greedy (-g), paranoia (-p), stoned (-s), tired (-t), wired (-w), young (-y).
- Flip the cow with the (-f) option.
- Write text in regular form, without treatment (-n). Be careful, this may cause issues with the cow's structure!
- Access the help menu (-h) for information on available options.
- Customize the cow's eyes with the (-E eyes) option.
- Select the cow's tongue with the (-T tongue) option.
- Define a maximum column size for the text between [1, 100] with the (-W size) option.
- Use a custom creature file with the (-F file) option.
- Align text to the left, right, center, or justify it with the (-J align) option.
